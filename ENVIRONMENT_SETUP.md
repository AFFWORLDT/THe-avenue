# Environment Setup Guide

## Required Environment Variables

To fully utilize all features of the website, you need to set up the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

### 1. reCAPTCHA Configuration (Optional for Development)

```bash
# Get these from https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_recaptcha_site_key_here
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_recaptcha_secret_key_here
```

**Note:** The website will work without reCAPTCHA keys in development mode. The lead capture form will function normally without the reCAPTCHA widget.

### 2. Email Service Configuration (Optional)

```bash
# Email service API key (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_email_service_api_key

# Email addresses
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@theavenue.ae
EMAIL_TO_ADDRESS=leads@theavenue.ae
```

### 3. Site Configuration

```bash
# Your website URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://theavenue.ae

# Database connection (if using database)
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create `.env.local` file** in your project root:
   ```bash
   touch .env.local
   ```

2. **Add the environment variables** to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   # Copy the variables above and replace with your actual values
   ```

3. **Restart your development server**:
   ```bash
